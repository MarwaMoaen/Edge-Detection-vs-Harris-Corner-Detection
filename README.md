# Edge-Detection-vs-Harris-Corner-Detection

This notebook explores and compares two fundamental feature detection techniques in computer vision:

* **Edge Detection (Canny)** → detects boundaries of objects.
* **Harris Corner Detection** → detects stable, distinctive points in images.

---

## 📌 Notebooks Included

1. **Classic Example (Lena test image)**

   * Demonstrates fundamentals with a standard test image.

2. **Real-World Example (Buildings)**

   * Applies both techniques on an architectural photo to show practical use cases.

---

## 📊 Results Preview

* **Edges** highlight outlines (shapes, contours).
* **Corners** highlight junctions (windows, rooftops, intersections).

Together, they are building blocks for:

* Object recognition
* Image matching & tracking
* Self-driving perception
* Augmented reality
